# discohook-forms
The [discohook](https://github.com/discohook/discohook) code used in the forms dashboard.

If you need a message renderer I suggest to copy the up to date code from [discohook](https://github.com/discohook/discohook) not from here because this is a modified version and I have left a lot of  things out.
